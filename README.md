## Notes

I wanted to build something that was different from the ordinary Quizlet style, something more gamefied. I recently became fascinated by the diverse patterns that are on the fronts of many card-based games. That's why I wanted to create a game with some kind of card deck that a player must unlock. 

I designed it in Figma, which didn't take me very long since I had a clear idea of what I wanted. Afterwards, I quickly created the CSS layout and styling, which also didn't take that long. What I struggled with the most was impelementing the different states and interactive functionalties that would make everything work. After going through the recorded lecture a couple of times and reading the additonal material, I pieced together all the parts to meet the needs of my project.
